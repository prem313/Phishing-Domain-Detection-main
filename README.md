# Phishing Domain Detection using Machine Learning


This repository contains a machine learning-based approach for detecting phishing domains. Phishing domains are fraudulent websites that imitate legitimate websites to steal sensitive information from users. This project aims to provide a tool that can identify potential phishing domains using various machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, making it essential to develop robust methods for detecting such fraudulent activities. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze and classify domain names as either legitimate or phishing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-domain-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd phishing-domain-detection`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section for details).
2. Extract relevant features from domain names (see [Features](#features) section for details).
3. Train and evaluate different machine learning models (see [Models](#models) section for details).

Example commands:
- To preprocess the dataset: `python preprocess.py --input dataset.csv --output preprocessed_data.csv`
- To train and evaluate models: `python train_and_evaluate.py --input preprocessed_data.csv`

## Dataset

We used a publicly available phishing domain dataset containing labeled examples of legitimate and phishing domain names. You can replace this dataset with your own data for customization.

## Features

To train the models, we extract a set of features from domain names. The features include domain length, use of numbers, use of special characters, subdomain count, Alexa rank, domain age, keywords in domain, and domain entropy. You can extend or modify these features based on your requirements.

## Models

We have implemented and included the following machine learning models:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Neural Networks)
4. XGBoost
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model can be trained and evaluated using the provided scripts.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. You can find detailed evaluation results in the evaluation reports generated during model training.
