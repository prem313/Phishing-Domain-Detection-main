# ## 6.1. Decision Tree Classifier
# Decision trees are widely used models for classification and regression tasks. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision. Learning a decision tree means learning the sequence of if/else questions that gets us to the true answer most quickly.
# 
# In the machine learning setting, these questions are called tests (not to be confused with the test set, which is the data we use to test to see how generalizable our model is). To build a tree, the algorithm searches over all possible tests and finds the one that is most informative about the target variable.

# ## 6.2. Random Forest Classifier
# Random forests for regression and classification are currently among the most widely used machine learning methods.A random forest is essentially a collection of decision trees, where each tree is slightly different from the others. The idea behind random forests is that each tree might do a relatively good job of predicting, but will likely overfit on part of the data.
# 
# If we build many trees, all of which work well and overfit in different ways, we can reduce the amount of overfitting by averaging their results. To build a random forest model, you need to decide on the number of trees to build (the n_estimators parameter of RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier). They are very powerful, often work well without heavy tuning of the parameters, and donâ€™t require scaling of the data.

# An auto encoder is a neural network that has the same number of input neurons as it does outputs. The hidden layers of the neural network will have fewer neurons than the input/output neurons. Because there are fewer neurons, the auto-encoder must learn to encode the input to the fewer hidden neurons. The predictors (x) and output (y) are exactly the same in an auto encoder.
